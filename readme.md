## Preparing the database

FastFood requieres the use of a MySQL server, once you have it, is necessary to import the SQL file that is in the release or in the database folder of the code. After import it you can configure the connection parameters in the login screen or in the config.ini file inside the program folder.

## How to begin?

The first time you enter on it you can login with the default Admin user.

`username: admin`

`password: admin`

Once you are in, is hardly important to change the password.

<sub><sup>After this if you want to add tables or products you can do it by yourself on the database directly (until version 1.5 will not be available by using the GUI).</sup></sub>
